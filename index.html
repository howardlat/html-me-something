        <h1>My Hobby - Making Candles and Wax Melts</h1>
    </header>
    <p>I have had many hobbies throughout my life like crotchet, sewing, and I have even tried painting.
        After a year or so of doing those things, I became bored and found a new hobby making candles 
        and wax melts.<br><br>
        I enjoy making candles and wax melts because I like the different scents you can add to the wax
        as well as colors. I also chose to use soy wax to make my candles and melts because it has no chemicals and 
        produces less candle soot which is the dark black ring around the top of the candle container.<br><br>  
        Below you will see some of the scented candles and wax melts I have handmade and detailed information
        about their scents.
